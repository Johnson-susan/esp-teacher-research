        <h2 style="color: #586069; font-weight: normal; margin-top: -10px;">A Discussion About Transforming Student Support</h2>
        
        <p class="description">
            I'm Susan Johnson - ESP and doctoral student at Northeastern University. This presentation is an academic exercise for the advanced research course in the CPS Education EdD program, in preparation for my dissertation-in-practice action research project about the collaborative relationship between Educational Service Professionals (ESP), i.e. paraeducators, and teachers.
        </p>
        
        <p class="description">
            Today isn't a recruitment pitch - it's a discussion about how we might transform ESP-teacher collaboration at our school. I want to share what I'm learning, get your insights on what could work here, and explore together what changes might be possible at different levels of our institution.
        </p>
        </p>
        
        <p class="description">
            This presentation is directed to "stakeholders" in this relationship - those to whom this inquiry has relevance. In action research, stakeholders collaborate with the researcher so feedback and input are necessary. Ideally, this presentation would be in person, or "synchronous", but since time and attention are stretched at this busy time and because of the major changes in stakeholder personnel expected this fall, I am offering this as an asynchronous presentation with a wiki for feedback.
        </p>

            Please feel free to ask questions, offer comment and critique, etc. Your attention and feedback is greatly appreciated!
